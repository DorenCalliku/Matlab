# Relationships
Here is the short work on matlab where I try to simplify relationships and to see how they change in an environment where the partners have different options. 

Basic Model: <br />
 <br />
  Alphabet: action, expectations, options. <br />
  expect(1) => expectations from participant 1.  <br />
  !expect(x) => decrease of expectations from participant x.  <br />
  !!expect(x) => participant x against expectations. <br />
  !action()(x) => repeated lack of actions from participant x.  <br />
  action(x) => action created from participant x.  <br />
 <br />

Picture to be added later.
