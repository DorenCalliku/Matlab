Relationships
-----
Here is the short work on matlab where I try to simplify relationships and to see how they change in an environment where the partners have different options. 

### Basic Model: 
-----
  Alphabet: action, expectations, options. <br />
  expect(1) => expectations from participant 1.  <br />
  !expect(x) => decrease of expectations from participant x.  <br />
  !!expect(x) => participant x against expectations. <br />
  !action()(x) => repeated lack of actions from participant x.  <br />
  action(x) => action created from participant x.  <br />
 <br />

Feel free to critique this model with examples or by pointing out its immense flaws of assumptions.<br /><br /> 

### Assumptions
-----
There are several types of people, and a range of genders. <br />
The way they connect is based on what they are, what is around them, and what is the history between the two (2 is chosen to simplify the problem).<br />
For the moment group decision making on individual cases is not included. <br />
This is a constrained model, does not take in consideration most of the third factors (economical, crisis, tragedies, outer problems).<br />
The logic is that if the two partners are logical people, they understand that the outer happenings cannot affect their relationship,<br />
maybe these happenings can show something about it.<br /><br />

### Idea
----
We are beings with personalities( inner characteristics which drive), we take action, create expectations
and if things go well - create delusions(single sided love or structured expectations).
Time we have spent together is measured by rounds, and it affects the importance of our actions. <br />
Our relationships are affected by the other options that we have around us in place of our partner. <br />
Our personality can be represented by economic_stability, psychological_stability, ambitions, colority. <br />
These have been chosen for simplisticity for the later inclusion of third factors.  <br />
Our relationships can be represented dynamically and then we can understand what actually happens to major social change. <br /><br />
Of course, this is a model not expected to express everything. It just can help create the idea of procedural relationships.<br />
