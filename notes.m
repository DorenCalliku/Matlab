I know, its not supposed to be this way - there is no way that human relationships can be represented by some numbers. 
If that is the case feel free to critique this model with examples or by pointing out its immense flaws of assumptions. 

Assumptions:
There are several types of people, and a range of genders. 
The way they connect is based on what they are, what is around them, and what is the history between the two (2 is chosen to simplify the problem).
For the moment group decision making on individual cases is not included. 
This is a constrained model, does not take in consideration most of the third factors (economical, crisis, tragedies, outer problems).
The logic is that if the two partners are logical people, they understand that the outer happenings cannot affect their relationship,
maybe these happenings can show something about it.

Idea: We are beings with personalities( inner characteristics which drive), we take action, create expectations,
and if things go well - create delusions(single sided love or structured expectations).
Time we have spent together is measured by rounds, and it affects the importance of our actions. 
Our relationships are affected by the other options that we have around us in place of our partner. 
Our personality can be represented by economic_stability, psychological_stability, ambitions, colority. 
These have been chosen for simplisticity for the later inclusion of third factors.  
Our relationships can be represented dynamically and then we can understand what actually happens to major social change. 

Of course, this is a model not expected to express everything. It just can help create the idea of procedural relationships.
